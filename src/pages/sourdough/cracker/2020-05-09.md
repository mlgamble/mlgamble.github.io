Combine all ingredients by hand--it's way easier. Keep adding flour until it's no longer sticky.

Put in fridge for 30+min

Preheat oven

Shape into a brick on parchment paper, keep flattening the brick while keeping the sides rectangular as flat as you can.

Once thinned by hand, roll out to be as thin as you want (doubles/triples in the oven)

Oil the top

Transfer to baking sheet

Grind salt over entire thing

Add whatever other herbs

Pizza wheel to desired size (does not change in oven). Poke holes all the way through each cracker (helps reduce them puffing up in the oven)
