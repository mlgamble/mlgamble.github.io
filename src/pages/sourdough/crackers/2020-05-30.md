Combine starter, flour, butter and herbs. Knead dough until it's smooth; add more flour if the dough is sticky. Final dough should be greasy and not sticky.
<br/>
Put in fridge for 30+ minutes.
<br/>
Preheat oven.
<br/>
Roll dough out on parchment paper: the thinner the better.
<br/>
Lightly oil and generously salt the entire area.
<br/>
Cut into squares. Poke a hole through the center of each cracker to stop them from pillowing.
<br/>
Bake until browned.
