Combine all ingredients and mix to create sticky ball. 

Leave uncovered, or at least breathable.

After 30 minutes stretch and fold, repeat another 3 times.

Continue uncovered.

Shape into a smooth ball, without fussing too much, flouring surface as needed.

Place into parchment paper lined bowl and place the bowl in the fridge.

Heat oven with pot in it.

When at tempurature put the parchment paper with dough in the pot into the oven.


#### Note

I bulk fermented with the bowl covered and it trapped a lot of moisture. My dough seemed wetter than the recipe's

This took way longer to cook than expected. Probably want to leave the lid on for 50-1hr, and lid off for only 15-20.

I didn't have a chance to rest the bread. And the bread wasn't cooked well.
